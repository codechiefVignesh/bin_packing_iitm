## Introduction
This documentation contains an exhaustive overview of the project and setting up the codes for 3d packing with visualisation. This documentation shall provide a comprehensive explanation to all codes and shall help in to proceed with future work as well. The whole project is prsent inside the packing directory.

## Basic Packing
Basic packing deals with the packing of items inside a container.Here if we are given dimensions of container and lists of the items and their dimensions. Then the code will give coordinates of the items as an output depicting as how and where to place the items inside the conatiner for better space utilisation. Here we have consider constraints like weight constraint which is the conatiner has a maximum holding capacity and no overlaping constraint which prevents two items to get overlaped coordinates.To view the code please click the link present in the table of contents.[Basic packing](https://github.com/codechiefVignesh/bin_packing_iitm/blob/main/Documentation/document1.md) 

This file contains the technology stack used an overview of the basic setup of packing without any constraints.
