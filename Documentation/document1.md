### Overview

The packing_3d function solves a 3D bin packing problem using Google's OR-Tools. The goal is to maximize the utilization of a truck's space by efficiently packing items of varying dimensions and weights. This function allows for the rotation of items and ensures that constraints such as weight capacity and no-overlap are maintained.

### Detailed Explanation
##### Import Statements

```
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model
from io import StringIO
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import json
```

* ortools.sat.python.cp_model: OR-Tools library for constraint programming.
* StringIO: Used for handling in-memory text streams.
* pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
* numpy: Library for numerical computations.
* json: Library for working with JSON data.

##### Function Definition

```
def packing_3d(data):
```

* data: A dictionary containing truck dimensions and items to be packed.

##### Input Data

```
truck_data = data["truck"]
items = data["items"]

df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(items)

L = truck_data["length"]
W = truck_data["width"]
H = truck_data["height"]
M = truck_data["maximum_capacity"]
```

* truck_data: Dictionary with truck dimensions (length, width, height) and maximum capacity (maximum_capacity).
* items: List of dictionaries representing items to be packed.
* df: Pandas DataFrame containing item information.
* L, W, H: Dimensions of the truck.
* M: Maximum weight capacity of the truck.


##### Derived Data

```
l0 = df["length"].to_numpy()
b0 = df['width'].to_numpy()
h0 = df['height'].to_numpy()
w0 = df['weight'].to_numpy()

n = len(l0)
```

* l0, b0, h0, w0: Numpy arrays representing the dimensions and weight of each item.
* n: Number of items.
